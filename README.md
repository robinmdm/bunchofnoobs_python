# Benefits:

We will enrich our Github profile, with projects notes
Also, if we have any sort of questions, we will ask there, opening an "issue"

# Task for tonight:

1. install Visual Studio code
2. open github account (if you do not have already)
3. download the video in your laptop https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DvywoWv6fI
