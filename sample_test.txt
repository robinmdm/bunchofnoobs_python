Challenge 1:

# Given a list of names, write a Python program that groups the names that have the same set of characters and returns the grouped names in a list of lists.

# names = [['PRAMIT'], ['SHUBHAM'], ['SWETHA'], ['ROLSTAN'], ['PRADEEP'], ['ROBIN']]

# Output: [["PRAMIT", "PRADEEP"], ["ROBIN", "ROLSTAN"], ["SHUBHAM", "SWETHA"]]

Challenge 2:

# data = [1,[12,'a'],['b','c',4],[5,'d','d'],[50,5]]

# Output: {"a": 50, "b": 12, "c": 5, "d": 4}

Challenge 3:

# Finding all the Pythagorean triplets within a given range of numbers. (1, 10)

# A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three positive integers, a, b and c, that satisfies the equation a^2 + b^2 = c^2.

# output: 3 4 5
          6 8 10
